<!--# SiVa overview-->

## What is SiVa?

SiVa (Signature Validation) web service provides JSON and SOAP based API web interface to validate digital signatures.
Please take a look in [Validation Policy](../appendix/validation_policy/) section for supported formats and applied constraints.

SiVa uses following Java libraries and command line utilities:

* DigiDoc4J Java library to validate BDOC (supported signature
  types are `TimeStamp` and `TimeMark`) and DDOC containers.
* EU DSS (Digital Signature Service) library is used to validate all other types of digital signatures that are not covered above.

## Validation libraries

### DigiDoc4j EU DSS fork

[DigiDoc4J EU DSS fork](https://github.com/open-eid/sd-dss) is used as the main validation library. The fork includes [Estonian specific changes](https://github.com/open-eid/sd-dss/wiki/BDoc-specific-modifications) and may not be suitable for all signatures.

**SiVa will use the following functionality of EU DSS library:**

* XAdES/CAdES/PAdES Validation Functionality
* ASIC-E and ASIC-S container validation
* TSL loading functionality

### DigiDoc4J

DigiDoc4J is used to validate both `TimeMark` and `TimeStamp` based BDOC and DDOC containers. For more information on DigiDoc4J visit [Github](https://github.com/open-eid/digidoc4j)
