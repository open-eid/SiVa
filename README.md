# Signature Verification Service

[![SiVa CI with Maven](https://github.com/open-eid/siva/actions/workflows/siva-verify.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/open-eid/siva/actions/workflows/siva-verify.yml)
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-EUPLv1.1-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-eid/SiVa/develop/LICENSE.md)

SiVa is digital signature validation web service that provides JSON API to validate following file types:

* Estonian DDOC containers
* Estonian BDOC containers with TimeMark and TimeStamp signatures
* Estonian ASiC-S containers with time stamp tokens
* ETSI standard based ASiC-E and ASiC-S containers
* ETSI standard based XAdES, CAdES and PAdES signatures
* ETSI standard based XAdES signatures with datafiles in hashcode form

### Libraries used in validation services

Below is list of Java libraries used for validation:

* [DigiDoc4J](https://github.com/open-eid/digidoc4j) - is used to validate DDOC and BDOC digital signature containers.
* [DigiDoc4J DSS fork](https://github.com/open-eid/sd-dss) - to validate all other digitally signed files.

## Requirements

These are minimum requirements to build and develop SiVa project:

* **git** - to easily download and update code. You can [download git here](https://git-scm.com/)
* **Java JDK 17** - to compile and run SiVa applications.
* **IDE** - to develop SiVa. We recommend to use [JetBrains IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* **2 GB of RAM** the RAM requirement is here because when building the project the integration tests take up a lot of memory
* Optionally You can also install **Maven** but it is not needed because SiVa project uses Maven wrapper to install maven

## How to build

### Using Maven Wrapper

Recommended way of building this project is using [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper).
Run following command:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

After that, you can optionally create an image for Docker:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -pl siva-parent/siva-webapp -DskipTests
```

## How-to run

### With docker

Before continuing, the [siva-demo-application](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-demo-application) docker image must be built and available on Docker as `siva-demo-application:latest`.

The following command will run siva-webapp along with siva-demo-application:

```
docker compose up
```

Now SiVa itself is accessible http://siva.localhost:8080/ and siva-demo-application http://siva-demo.localhost:9000/.
Logs for all running containers can be viewed at http://localhost:11080.

### Without docker

SiVa project compiles **2 fat executable JAR** files that You can run after successfully building the
project by issuing below command:

**Starting the SiVa REST webservice. NB! X.X.X denotes the version you are running.**

```bash
java -jar siva-parent/siva-webapp/target/siva-webapp-X.X.X-exec.jar
```

The SiVa webapp by default runs on port **8080**.

Easiest way to test out validation is to [start SiVa Demo Application without docker](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-demo-application#without-docker).

## WAR and Tomcat setup for legacy systems

> **NOTE**: Each SiVa service **must** be deployed to separate instance of Tomcat to avoid Java JAR library version
> conflicts.

To build the WAR file use helper script with all the correct Maven parameters.

```bash
./build-war.sh
```

Copy built WAR file into Tomcat `webapps` directory and start the servlet container. NB! X.X.X denotes the version you are running.

```bash
cp siva-parent/siva-webapp/target/siva-webapp-X.X.X.war apache-tomcat-7.0.70/webapps
./apache-tomcat-7.0.77/bin/catalina.sh run
```

> **IMPORTANT** siva-webapp on startup creates `etc` directory where it copies the TSL validation certificates
> `siva-keystore.jks` (or `test-siva-keystore.jks` if `test` profile is used). Default location for this directory
> is application root or `$CATALINA_HOME`. To change this default behavior you should set environment variable
> `DSS_DATA_FOLDER`

### How-to set WAR deployed SiVa `application.properties`

SiVa override properties can be set using `application.properties` file. The file can locate anywhare in the host system.
To make properties file accessible for SiVa you need to create or edit `setenv.sh` placed inside `bin` directory.

Contents of the `setenv.sh` file should look like:

```bash
export CATALINA_OPTS="-Dspring.config.location=file:/path/to/application.properties"
```

## How-to run tests

Unit test are integral part of the SiVa code base. The tests are automatically executed every
time the application is built. The build will fail if any of the tests fail.

To execute the tests from command line after application is built use:

```bash
./mvnw verify
```

### How to run integration tests
Integration tests can be found [here](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-Test), and executing them requires running SiVa Web application instance.

### How to run integration tests in docker
Before starting the docker instances, the `docker-compose.yaml` file must be modified. Add the following under the siva-webapp service to run the docker image with the test profile:

```
environment:
  - "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=test"
```

### How to run load tests

Load tests are available in the [SiVa-perftests](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-perftests) repository.
