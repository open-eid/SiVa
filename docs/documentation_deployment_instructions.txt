* **pip** - Python package manager
* **Text Editor** - to edit Markdown documents (i.e [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/#))

Installing required software
-----------------

### Ubuntu and Mac OS X

Both Ubuntu and Mac OS X come `python` already installed (the version depends on OS)

1.  Install `pip` on Ubuntu 18.04 `sudo apt-get install python-pip` on Mac OS X `sudo easy_install pip`
2.  Install `mkdocs` using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/): `pip install mkdocs`
3.  Install material theme `pip install mkdocs-material`

### Windows

1. Install python. Download the installer from the official `python` homepage: <https://www.python.org/downloads/> and install
> **NOTE:** Starting with version 2.7.9 and onwards `pip` ships along with python, so there shouldn't be any need to install `pip` separately.
2. Install `mkdocs` using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/): `pip install mkdocs`
3.  Install material theme `pip install mkdocs-material`

PS! There can be a need to add the directory, were `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material` were installed, manually to the PATH.
