## Test execution

Execution of tests in SiVa is divided in three categories: Automated, Automated SoapUI, Manual. The method is also indicated in test case description with TestType field.

### Execution of Automated type of tests

These tests are run automatically by Maven every time SiVa project is built. These tests must pass for the build to be successful. Its also possible to execute the tests separately with Maven wrapper using the command:

```bash
./mvnw verify
```

These tests are part of SiVa project and can also be executed using IntellJ IDEA. To do that, SiVa project must be loaded into IDEA. Tests are located in following packages:
  
  * ee.openeid.siva.integrationtest
  * ee.openeid.siva.resttest
  * ee.openeid.siva.soaptest

To run the tests in IDEA right click on package name and select "Run tests in". It's also possible to run individual tests by right clicking on specific test code and selecting "Run". 

### Execution of Automated SoapUI type of tests

The description how to execute the tests together with SoapUI project file to be used can be found in [SiVa GitHub](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa/tree/master/test-helpers/XRoadSoapUITests)

### Execution of Manual type of tests

Most of the manual tests require that SiVa service is set up together with [SiVa Demo Application](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-demo-application). 
The instructions how to set up SiVa are given in [System deployment guide](http://open-eid.github.io/SiVa/siva3/deployment_guide/)

Execution of manual tests depends on testable area. These tests can be divided into following categories:

  * Statistics tests - test data can be prepeared with exectuting ee.openeid.siva.manualtest package. It can be also generated by uploading files into SiVa Demo application. Results have to be verified in logs.
  * Report tests - test data can be prepeared with exectuting ee.openeid.siva.manualtest package. Results have to be verified manually.
  * Configuration tests - SiVa configuration files have to be modified by hand and service must be set up. Correct behavior of the service must be checked.
  * Other tests - tests are executed by loading files into SiVa Demo application and validating the results shown in the SiVa Demo application.

Files to use in manual tests can be found in [SiVa GitHub](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-Test/tree/master/src/test/resources)
  
## Integration Test introduction

This section of the document gives overview of Integration Testing carried out on SiVa web service and SiVa Demo application.

SiVa web service Integration Testing is using IO RestAssured library to implement automatic checks for REST/SOAP based tests.

The testing of the SiVa web service is divided into sections based on the software architecture and functionalities provided to the users. The sections are:

  * REST API
  * SOAP API
  * DDOC container signature validation
  * BDOC container signature validation
  * ASICE container signature validation
  * ASIC-S container signature validation
  * PDF signature validation
  * XAdES hashcode validation

The goal is to focus testing on functionalities implemented in SiVa web service application. Functionalities provided by [Validation libraries](../overview/#Validation-libraries) are not explicitly tested.

In addition SiVa Demo Application is tested. These tests are carried out manually.

## Testing of REST API

The goal of the REST API testing is to check that the API is accepting the requests based on the specification and the output result is in correct format and has all the required elements.

### Validation request tests

Following areas are tested on input:

  * Wrong (not accepted) values in input parameters
  * Empty values in input paramters
  * Too many parameters
  * Too few parameters
  * Inconsistencies on stated parameters and actual data (wrong document type)
  * Case insensitivity on parameter names
  * Empty request
  * Request body size limit


In all of the negative cases correctness of returned error message is checked.

Specific test cases and input files can be found in:

  * [ValidationRequestIT.java](../appendix/test_cases/#validationrequestitjava)
  * [DocumentFormatIT.java](../appendix/test_cases/#documentformatitjava)
  * [HashcodeValidationRequestIT.java](../appendix/test_cases/#hashcodevalidationrequestitjava)

### Get Data Files request tests

Following areas are tested on input:

  * Empty request
  * Empty values in input parameters
  * Too many parameters
  * Too few parameters
  * Changed order of parameters

  * Inconsistencies on stated parameters and actual data
  * Request body size limit

In all of the negative cases correctness of returned error message is checked.

  * Layout of the page
  * Error representation

Sample test cases with input files can be found in:

  * [Demo Application Integration Test](appendix/test_cases#demo-application-integration-test) 
  
## System Test introduction

While Integration Tests were mostly carried out automatically then System Testing is mostly depending on manual testing.

System testing is carried out using two access points:

  * Testing through SiVa Demo Application
  * Testing through X-Road security server using SoapUI

!!! Note
 
	Testing through X-Road security server requires presence and configuration of X-Road security server to use SiVa service.  Tests are run using SoapUI that simulates request to X-Road security server.

## Testing through X-Road security server

Following areas are covered for document validation:

  * Validation of valid signature
  * Validation of invalid signatur
  * Validation that returns Soap error

All of the above test cases are run with BDOC, DDOC, PDF and ASIC-S containers. 

Following areas are covered for file extraction:

  * Extraction of data files from valid ddoc
  * Extraction of data files from invalid ddoc
  * Error response from data file extraction  

Tests along with test case descriptions are available for rerun in [github](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa/tree/develop/test-helpers/XRoadSoapUITests).

Specific test cases and input files can be found in:

  * [X-Road Soap System Test](../appendix/test_cases/#x-road-soap-system-test)

## Configuration/administration testing

Following areas are covered:

  * SiVa Web Application configuration
  * Demo application configuration

Specific test cases can be found in:

  * [Configuration System Test](../appendix/test_cases/#configuration-system-test)  

## Performance testing
