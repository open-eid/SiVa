## Test execution

Execution of tests in SiVa is divided in two categories: Automated and Manual. The method is also indicated in test case description with TestType field.

### Execution of Automated type of tests

These tests are run automatically by Maven every time SiVa project is built. These tests must pass for the build to be successful. It's also possible to execute the tests separately with Maven wrapper using the command:

```bash
./mvnw verify
```

These tests are part of SiVa project and can also be executed using IntellJ IDEA. To do that, SiVa project must be loaded into IDEA. Tests are located in following packages:
  
  * ee.openeid.siva.integrationtest
  * ee.openeid.siva.resttest

To run the tests in IDEA right click on package name and select "Run tests in". It's also possible to run individual tests by right-clicking on specific test code and selecting "Run". 

### Execution of Manual type of tests

Most of the manual tests require that SiVa service is set up together with [SiVa Demo Application](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-demo-application). 
The instructions how to set up SiVa are given in [System deployment guide](http://open-eid.github.io/SiVa/siva3/deployment_guide/)

Execution of manual tests depends on testable area. These tests can be divided into following categories:

  * Statistics tests - test data can be prepared with executing ee.openeid.siva.manualtest package. It can be also generated by uploading files into SiVa Demo application. Results have to be verified in logs.
  * Report tests - test data can be prepared with executing ee.openeid.siva.manualtest package. Results have to be verified manually.
  * Configuration tests - SiVa configuration files have to be modified by hand and service must be set up. Correct behavior of the service must be checked.
  * Other tests - tests are executed by loading files into SiVa Demo application and validating the results shown in the SiVa Demo application.

Files to use in manual tests can be found in [SiVa GitHub](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-Test/tree/master/src/test/resources)
  
## Integration Test introduction

This section of the document gives overview of Integration Testing carried out on SiVa web service and SiVa Demo application.

SiVa web service Integration Testing is using IO RestAssured library to implement automatic checks for REST based tests.

The testing of the SiVa web service is divided into sections based on the software architecture and functionalities provided to the users. The sections are:

  * REST API
  * DDOC container signature validation
  * BDOC container signature validation
  * ASICE container signature validation
  * ASIC-S container signature validation
  * PDF signature validation
  * XAdES hashcode validation

The goal is to focus testing on functionalities implemented in SiVa web service application. Functionalities provided by [Validation libraries](../background/#validation-libraries) are not explicitly tested.

In addition, SiVa Demo Application is tested. These tests are carried out manually.

## Testing of REST API

The goal of the REST API testing is to check that the API is accepting the requests based on the specification and the output result is in correct format and has all the required elements.

### Validation request tests

Following areas are tested on input:

  * Wrong (not accepted) values in input parameters
  * Empty values in input parameters
  * Too many parameters
  * Too few parameters
  * Inconsistencies on stated parameters and actual data (wrong document type)
  * Case insensitivity on parameter names
  * Empty request
  * Request body size limit


In all of the negative cases correctness of returned error message is checked.

Specific test cases and input files can be found in:

  * [ValidationRequestIT.java](../appendix/test_cases/#validationrequestitjava)
  * [DocumentFormatIT.java](../appendix/test_cases/#documentformatitjava)
  * [HashcodeValidationRequestIT.java](../appendix/test_cases/#hashcodevalidationrequestitjava)

### Get Data Files request tests

Following areas are tested on input:

  * Empty request
  * Empty values in input parameters
  * Too many parameters
  * Too few parameters
  * Changed order of parameters
  * Case insensitivity on parameter names
  * Inconsistencies on stated parameters and actual data
  * Request body size limit

In all of the negative cases correctness of returned error message is checked.

Specific test cases and input files can be found in:

  * [GetDataFileRequestIT.java](../appendix/test_cases/#getdatafilerequestitjava)

### Validation report and report signature tests

SiVa web service returns uniform Validation Report on all the supported document types. This also includes correct document types without actual signature (for example PDF document without signature).

Following areas are tested on output (Validation Report):

  * JSON structure on DDOC, BDOC, PDF, ASIC-E, ASIC-S, XAdES hashcode 
  * Presence of the mandatory elements on DDOC, BDOC, PDF, ASIC-E, ASIC-S, XAdES hashcode

  * Validation results are printed to system log and can be gathered by any suitable means

Following areas are covered:

  * Statistics values are checked in log for all container types (this also includes parameters not present in validation report)
  * Valid and invalid signatures are validated
  * Error situations on signature validation (instead of validation report, error message is returned)
  
Specific test cases and input files can be found in:

  * [StatisticsToLogsManualIT.java](../appendix/test_cases/#statisticstologsmanualitjava)
  
## SiVa Demo Application tests

Testing of [SiVa Demo Application](https://github.com/open-eid/SiVa-demo-application) is done manually. The main cases are:

  * Cross browser usage (IE, Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari)
  * File upload (different sizes, supported and unsupported file types)
  * Displayment of Validation Report for REST
  * Layout of the page
  * Error representation

Sample test cases with input files can be found in:

  * [Demo Application Integration Test](../appendix/test_cases#demo-application-integration-test) 
  
## System Test introduction

While Integration Tests were mostly carried out automatically then System Testing is mostly depending on manual testing.

System testing is carried out using following access points:

  * Testing through SiVa Demo Application

!!! Note
 
	Testing through X-Road security server requires presence and configuration of X-Road security server to use SiVa service.

## Testing through X-Road security server

Following areas are covered for document validation:
